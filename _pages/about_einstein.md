I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Science and Engineering at Tennessee State University. I direct the Nursery Automation and Robotics Laboratory at the Otis L. Floyd Nursery Research Center in McMinnville, Tennessee. Prior to joining TSU, I was a postdoctoral scholar in Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Penn State University, working with [Long He](https://abe.psu.edu/directory/luh378). I earned my Ph.D. from Washington State University in 2023 under the supervision of [Qin Zhang](https://bsyse.wsu.edu/people/faculty/zhang/) and [Manoj Karkee](https://cals.cornell.edu/people/manoj-karkee), and my M.S. and B.S. in Agricultural Engineering from China Agricultural University.
