My name is Chenchen Kang (康琛琛). I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agricultural Science and Engineering at Tennessee State University, based at the Otis L. Floyd Nursery Research Center in McMinnville, Tennessee. My research focuses on advancing agricultural automation and digital technologies to support specialty crop production.

**Research Interests**

* **Precision and autonomous agricultural machinery** – design and evaluation of intelligent systems to improve efficiency and sustainability.

* **AI, computer vision, and field robotics in agriculture** – developing smart sensing and robotic solutions for crop monitoring and management.

* **Modeling, simulation, and control of agricultural systems** – creating data-driven and physics-based models to optimize resource use and system performance.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
